# SQL Fundamentals Project

## Introduction

This project serves as a hands-on guide to understanding and manipulating structured data using fundamental SQL (Structured Query Language) concepts. It demonstrates core SQL operations and explains more advanced topics like JOINS, subqueries, views, and indexes.

While a traditional SQL database was not used directly, the demonstrations leverage Python's Pandas library to simulate SQL query functionalities on a CSV dataset, providing a practical understanding of how these operations transform data.

## Concepts Covered

The project systematically covers the following SQL concepts:

* **`SELECT`**: Used for retrieving data from a table.
* **`WHERE`**: Filters records based on specified conditions.
* **`ORDER BY`**: Sorts the result-set in ascending or descending order.
* **`GROUP BY`**: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into a summary row, often used with aggregate functions.
* **Aggregate Functions**:
    * `SUM()`: Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.
    * `AVG()`: Calculates the average value of a numeric column.
* **`JOINS` (Conceptual Explanation)**:
    * `INNER JOIN`: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
    * `LEFT JOIN` (or `LEFT OUTER JOIN`): Returns all records from the left table, and the matching records from the right table.
    * `RIGHT JOIN` (or `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`): Returns all records from the right table, and the matching records from the left table.
* **Subqueries**: A query nested inside another SQL query, used to return data that serves as a condition for the main query.
* **Views (Conceptual Explanation)**: Virtual tables based on the result-set of a SQL query, used for simplifying complex queries, restricting access, and providing data independence.
* **Indexes (Conceptual Explanation)**: Special lookup tables used by database search engines to speed up data retrieval operations.

## Data Source

The project utilizes the following dataset:

* `data.csv`: A CSV file containing transactional data (InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID).

## Tools and Technologies

* **Python**: The primary programming language used for data manipulation.
* **Pandas**: A powerful Python library for data analysis and manipulation, used here to mimic SQL operations on the `data.csv` file.

## How to Explore

To explore the demonstrations and code yourself:
1. **Save `data.csv`**: Ensure the `data.csv` file is in the same directory as your Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
2.  **Install Pandas**: If you don't have Pandas installed, you can install it via pip:
    
3.  **Run the Python Code**: Execute the Python code snippets provided in the project to see the SQL-like operations in action. You can use an interactive Python interpreter, a `.py` script, or a Jupyter Notebook for a more structured learning environment.

## Key Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this project, you will have a solid understanding of:

* How to select and filter data using `SELECT` and `WHERE` clauses.
* How to sort data using `ORDER BY`.
* How to group and aggregate data using `GROUP BY` with functions like `SUM` and `AVG`.
* The principles of joining multiple tables (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` JOINS).
* The concept and application of subqueries for complex filtering.
* The role and benefits of database `VIEWS` for data abstraction and security.
* The importance of `INDEXES` for query optimization in a database.

This project aims to provide a practical foundation for anyone looking to learn or reinforce their SQL skills for data analysis and manipulation.
